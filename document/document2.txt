HTML, CSS AND GRID960


















Introduction
This is a document which will give you a brief introduction about the web development technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and GRID960.
If you are new in the field of web designing, you might be searching the different sources from where can you study the basics concept of designing a website.
So you may consider this as one of efficient source, which will give you a full 360 view that how we professionally built a website.
This will help you to build a website with ease. Besides of paying anyone, it will make you capable to build a website of your own choice.
By this you will be able to form a base form new technologies like BOOTSTRAP4.

2.Environment Setup
Before starting with the concepts lets first set the environment for web development. You may need the following to work:-
1)Text Editor-Notepad and Notepad++ will work fine but we generally use Sublime Text 3 or Atom or Brackets. These are all text editor but the provide content assist which will save your time by typing the code and you can probably focus more on the designing part .
Link for Sublime Text 3: https://www.sublimetext.com/3
Link for Atom: https://atom.io/
Link for Brackets: http://brackets.io/
2)(Optional)A temporary server-You may run your code on a browser like Chrome and firefox but if you will test on a server you will get a better way to test your application. For that you may install NodeJs.
Link to install NodeJs for windows: https://nodejs.org/en/
For Linux and Mac, run the following command-
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
Now all the users can check whether NodeJs has been installed successfully by using the commands-
node —version
npm —version
If both are working fine then you may need to install a http server. You cna do that by writing the following command-
sudo npm install -g http-server
And inside the working folder type the following command to initiate a server-
http-server
3)Grid960 Files-Go to https://960.gs/ and download the the zip file from the download option at the left top. Extract it and copy the the files 960.css, reset.css, text.css present inside code->css and paste in to a seprete folder and name that folder as 960.
Now you are all set to work with web develpment.






The href attribute specifies the destination address of the link.
The link text is the visible part.
Clicking on the link text will send you to the specified address.
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
The target attribute can have one of the following values:
_blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
_self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)
_parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window
framename - Opens the linked document in a named frame
HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a Web page.
Bookmarks can be useful if your webpage is very long.
To make a bookmark, you must first create the bookmark, and then add a link to it.
When the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.
Example
First, create a bookmark with the id attribute:



<form>
  <input type="radio" name="gender" value="male" checked> Male<br>
  <input type="radio" name="gender" value="female"> Female<br>
  <input type="radio" name="gender" value="other"> Other
</form>

3.11.2 The Submit Button
<input type="submit"> defines a button for submitting the form data.

3.11.3 The Action Attribute
The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.
<form action="destination.html">
If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current page.

3.11.4 The Target Attribute
The target attribute specifies if the submitted result will open in a new browser tab, a frame, or in the current window.
The default value is "_self" which means the form will be submitted in the current window.
To make the form result open in a new browser tab, use the value "_blank":

CSS
1.Prerequisite- 
1)You should know the basic of html.
2)Follow the standard to write a web page which include the basic folder structure and the naming conventions.
1.1 Naming conventions-
For folders:
Inside a main parent folder, make three folders:
1)For Html files
2)For images

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML.
This is a basic Css syntax-









3. Types of CSS-
CSS is added to HTML pages to format the document according to information in the style sheet. There are three ways to insert CSS in HTML documents.
1.Inline CSS
2.Internal CSS
3.External CSS


3.1) Inline CSS
It is is used to apply CSS on a single line or element.
For example:

<p style="color:blue">Hello CSS</p> 

3.2) Internal CSS
Internal CSS is used to apply CSS on a single document or page.
For example:

<style>  
p{
color: red
}  
</style>  

3.3) External CSS
External CSS is used to apply CSS on multiple pages or all pages. We write all the CSS code in a css file. Its extension must be .css 
For example:

p{color:blue}  
You need to link this style.css file to your html pages:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">  



3.4.ID
Id's are unique.
Each element can have only one ID.
Each page can have only one element with that ID.

Syntax-
      <html>
       <head>
<style>
#place {  background-color: skyblue;}
</style>
</head> 
      <body>
       <h2 class="place">A</h2>
      </body>
       </html>


3.5.Classes
Classes are not unique.
You can use the same class on multiple elements.
You can use multiple classes on the same element.
Syntax-


        <html>
       <head>
<style>
.place {
    background-color: ;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
} 
</style>
</head> 
<body>
<h2 class="place">A</h2>
<h2 class="place">B</h2>
<h2 class="place">C</h2>
</body>
     </html>



3.6 Padding-
CSS Padding property is used to define the space between the element content and the element border.
<!DOCTYPEhtml>  
<html>  
<head>  
<style>  
p {
background-color: pink;
 }  
p.applypadding {  
padding-top: 50px;  
padding-right: 100px;  
padding-bottom: 150px;  
 padding-left: 200px;  
}  
</style>  
</head>  
<body>  
<p>This is a paragraph with no specified padding</p>  
<p class="applypadding">This is a paragraph with specified padding</p>  
</body>  
</html>  

3.7 Margin-
CSS Margin property is used to define the space around elements.
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
<style>  
p {  
background-color: red;  
}  
p.margin {  
margin-top: 50px;  
margin-bottom: 50px;  
margin-right: 100px;  
margin-left: 100px;  
}  
</style>  
</head>  
<body>   
<p class="margin">This paragraph is displayed with specified margin.</p>  
</body>  
</html>  









1.Grid 960:- 
Grid 960 is a framework which help you to define the structure of your web page in the form of grids.
1.1) 12 Column Grid-

By grid 960 you can easily define the structure within any confusion.
In the 12-column version, the narrowest column is 60 pixels wide. Each column after that increases by 80 pixels.
So the available column widths are: 60, 140, 220, 300, 380, 460, 540, 620, 700, 780, 860 and 940.Similarly, in the 16-column version, the narrowest column is 40 pixels wide and each column after that increases by 60 pixels.







1.2) 16 Column Grid-


The whole page is divided into a 12 or 16 column grid. We take a main container which will contain all the elements.
Once defining the container you need to define the grids. You have to do it it such a way in grid 12 that the addition of all the elements in one grid is 12.
We have downloaded the files of grid 960 and placed them into the css folder. Now we need to link them into the html .
Example-
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/960/960.css"/>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/960/reset.css"/>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/960/text.css"/>
Eg.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>My Profile</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/960/960.css"/>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/960/reset.css"/>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/960/text.css"/>
</head>

<body>
<div class="container_12">                //This will take all the 12 columns
<div class="grid_12">
<h1>Name</h1>
</div>

<div class="grid_6">
<h3>Description</h3>
</div>					//In this the two div will share a grid equally
<div class="grid_6">
<h3>Others</h3>
</div>
</body>
</html>


Thus by using 960 grid we can easily imagine the placement of various element on the screen without actually placing them.
Thus this is the whole overview of Web development using html, css and grid 960.






Conclusion-
This is all about the web development with the help of Html, Css and Grid960.
